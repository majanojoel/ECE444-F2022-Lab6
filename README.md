## What are the pros and cons of TDD?

The pros of TDD is that it encourages more modular code that can be easier to write, debug, and maintain. One of the hardest things to do is making sure code can be tested extensively, so by having tests as the first step, writing testable code becomes natural. In addition, the code will often turn out to be easier to understand as tests can be written in a descriptive way, so the goal of the code that is being tested can be well defined. Another benefit is that TDD helps to prevent bugs that depend on each other, because code is usually written per test. If something goes wrong it can make refactoring and rewriting easier and faster. TDD also encourages constant reflection and improvement of the codebase. This often exposes areas and abstractions in the code that need to be rethought, which helps drive and improve the overall design. 

The cons of TDD is that it is slower to get started since it takes time to write the tests and actually begin implementing features. Another downside is that if product requirements change, the test suite must be updated to accommodate these changes first, and then code can be rewritten. This makes big changes slower to deploy as time must be spent refactoring test cases. In addition, TDD can be complicated to learn and requires practice and dedication as it represents a large change from the traditional way of writing code. It can be frustrating to begin with as it seems like a time sink, but over the longer duration, this process saves a lot of development time.â€¯Finally, it is difficult to narrow down the tests and make them as simple as possible while also not being trivial.
